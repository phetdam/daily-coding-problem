This directory contains (mostly Python) solutions to problems from Daily Coding Problem, as well a package `simple_ds` that has simple implementations of common data structures and related helpful functions. `simple_ds` was created on 12-23-2019 for the purpose of streamlining the problem solving process in the spirit of `sol_template.py`. See the `README` for `simple_ds` in the package directory for more details on the package.

Any errors are wholly my own. I make clear when I needed help on a problem and used or derived inspiration from someone else's solution. Most of the solutions are all in Python; each is well documented (with a `__doc__` string) and save for the first problem all in the standard format specified by `sol_template.py`.

*Tip for finding problems:* Use the `F3` key or `C-f` (`Ctrl-f`) and search by the problem number to find specific problems by the text of the commit message. However, the first six problems have the same commit message, "added first 6 problems i got from daily coding problem", so you will have to find them by hand. The first 6 problems are, in alphabetical order, with problem number in parentheses for your convenience,

* `bt_serialize.py` (#3), `ksum.py` (#1), `missing_int.py` (#4), `pair.py` (#5), `xonesum.py` (#2), `xorll.py` (#6)
