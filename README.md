This directory contains (mostly Python) solutions to problems from Daily Coding Problem.

Any errors are wholly my own. I make clear when I needed help on a problem and used or derived inspiration from someone else's solution. Most of the solutions are all in Python; each is well documented (with a \_\_doc\_\_ string) and save for the first problem all in the standard format specified by sol_template.py.

*Tip for finding problems:* Use the `F3` key or `C-f` (`Ctrl-f`) and search by the problem number to find specific problems by the text of the commit message. However, the first six problems have the same commit message, "added first 6 problems i got from daily coding problem", so you will have to find them by hand. The first 6 problems are, in alphabetical order, with problem number in parentheses for your convenience,

* bt_serialize.py (#3), ksum.py (#1), missing_int.py (#4), pair.py (#5), xonesum.py (#2), xorll.py (#6)
