## History

Three years ago in 2019, during my sophomore year in college, I first
subscribed to Daily Coding Problem to get some interview practice. Now that I
am a "working adult", I have decided to rework some of these problems just to
refresh my brain and to practice writing some C++, which has become my
preferred language, although I have recently cleaned up some legacy C and
Python code in this repo as well.

## About

This directory contains (mostly Python) solutions to problems from Daily Coding
Problem, as well a package `simple_ds` that has simple implementations of
common data structures and related helpful functions. `simple_ds` was created
on 12-23-2019 for the purpose of streamlining the problem solving process in
the spirit of `sol_template.py`. See the `README` for `simple_ds` in the
package directory for more details on the package.

Any errors are wholly my own. I make clear when I needed help on a problem and
used or derived inspiration from someone else's solution. Most of the solutions
are all in Python; each is well documented (with a `__doc__` string) and save
for the first problem all in the standard format specified by `sol_template.py`.

*Tip for finding problems:* ~~Use the `F3` key or `C-f` (`Ctrl-f`)~~ Daily
Coding Problem doesn't really title problems and the numerical order is based
on when you subscribed, so specific problems are a bit difficult to find. It's
best to just pick some random numbers out of a hat when browsing for problems.
